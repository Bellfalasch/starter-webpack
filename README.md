# Webpack Starter for Enonic XP

This starter kit will set up a basic template for your new Enonic app, with support for the Webpack.

Once initiated, you'll have the bare minimum needed to create a new Enonic
application with Webpack. You'll have all the folders set up, and can get
straight to creating what you're creating.

The project will support:
* Code minification;
* Production and development environments;
* SASS and Less support;
* Transpilation to ES5 with Babel.


## Usage XP 7

You first need to install Enonic CLI. Then run the following commands to build and depoy it:

```bash
~ $ enonic project create
... Answer wizard question

Your brand new app should now be up and running on http://localhost:8080
